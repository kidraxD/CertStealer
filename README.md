# CertStealer
This tool allows you to take the cert from a existing file, and apply it to another unsigned file. I made this tool pretty fast so its not super optimized.
If have or find any issue, just say it in the issue tab, im happy to help.

# Why?
To me this is a POC to show how easy it is to steal signatures.

# FAQ
`Will this work on drivers?`
No, this wont work on drivers as the sign is not fully valid.

`Can I sign a virus with this so the antivirus doesnt see it?`
No, most antiviruses scan for code not for signs.
